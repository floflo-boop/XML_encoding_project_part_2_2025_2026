## First look 

At the first look, we can see that my DTD file was more specialized than the TEI_all schema. 

With the TEI, I had to play a lot with attributes and TEI_all not alway provide the attributes I was seeking for. Most of the time, I had to use some elements or attributes that are note made for my kind use but which can respond to them. 

<br>

## Three points for the TEI_all 

1. Compared to my DTD, TEI permitted more flexibility. Letters of "poilus" are way more diverse thant I thought. Some of them have printed elements, other not, and if it is the case it is note always the same element at the same spot etc. My DTD was to strict on those elements, and TEI_all mostly thanks to the attributs system was way more flexible. 

<br>

2. The attributes. TEI_all permitted a lot of attributes and those are really flexible. I was able to use one attribut for different meaning which is more simple for encoding and reading. My DTD did not provided much attributes and was more focus on elements, which permitted less linked to other sources, to external entities, where TEI encourage it and so enriched my encoding.

3. The metadatas are richer and more simple with TEI_all than with my DTD. I was able to give more contextuality and more information usefull for the understanding where my DTD was really sommar.

## One point of default for the TEI_all 

In the TEI_all i was not able to add, as external entiti, a list of events that will allow me to make references to historical envents and context. I tried and the implementation of it has been impossible.

## The custom TEI schema 

I hope that a TEI custom schema will allow me to insert more easily, by external means or note, a list of events. It can really be a great point for my encoding to have a detail list of events and even subevents linked to my files in order to enrich my sources. 

More generally, I hop to build a TEI custom schema which can have a form of balance between the overly general nature of TEI_all, which guarantees flexibility, and the overspecialization of my DTD. Maybe by adding more specialized element and keeping the richness in attribute.
