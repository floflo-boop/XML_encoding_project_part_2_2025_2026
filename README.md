# My project 

As part 1, my project is to propose a way of enconding soldier's letters from the First Wolrd War. 

I have change a little bit my project. At the beginning I thought encoding letters from different country and languages. The project was to create link between slang developped in this war, which is unique to it, by different soldier's of different nationalities in order to make links between those letters. It seems to be a little bit ambitious because it asked a lot of ressources that I do not have at my disposition. I have no knowledge about English trench slang, and concerning the colonies that have been implied in the war I have even less knowledge. And, in my mind, make such correspondancy between different slang from different language will ask some technical knowledge as making database that I do not have for the moment. 

So, it seemed more reachable to focus on french soldier's, called "poilus", letters especially since they do not appear to be transcribed in XML, or rarely, and there is therefore no standardization for their encoding. 

My project aimed to propose, basing on the TEI_all schema, a way of encding those rich sources with a focus on encoding the grammar, slang trench particulary, and expressions proper at that war, like word coming from propaganda. On a second side, I aimed to focus ont the identification of the personn, the places and the events related to the writing of those letters _(metadatas)_ such as those same element contained in letters. 

With thos two objective, I want to propose a way of making a digital edition, and not just a transcribing, of those letters.

# My materials 

I have choosen three letters from three different "poilus" and there still are the same sources. 

Two letters are coming from the same archival collections, municipal archives of Reims. It is two different "poilus" who wrote them on the same front but 1 mont apart between november and december 1914. They are the same as part 1 assignment. 

My third letters is a new one. The older one was not a "poilus" letters so I had to change. This one come from an undintefied "poilus" from the archive of the Manche departement. She's writtent in August 1914 at Chalons en Champagne in the Marne departement. I took it from a PDF which present different letters from different soldiers, I took the first one _(you will find the original PDF and a cropped one which present only the first letters.)_

I have choose them because they are different in there physical and logical structure. But they still propose the same interest.

# My approach 

As described a little in the "My project" part, my approach is to propose a digital edition as well as a way of encoding those text. 

So I tried to select the elements that seems to be pertient to propose a digital edition focused on make those sources exploitable more easily for lexical and linguistic studies as well as genalogical research.
